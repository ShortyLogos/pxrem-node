# PXREM CLI - NODE VERSION

## What's this?

This is a small CLI designed to convert pixel values in web development-related files to rem values. The default root font size used for calculations is 16, but you can specify another size using the parameters listed below.

## Alternatives

Note that you can achieve the same functionality directly within VSCode.

## Why?

I created this small project for fun over a couple of hours. I primarily work as a front-end developer using React. Exploring this CLI was a nostalgic journey into the realm of object-oriented programming (OOP), although I could have built it using a procedural approach. Like many developers, I sometimes tend to over-engineer things.

## What's next?

As I write this, I'm in the process of learning Go just for fun. It's entirely possible that I might create an equivalent version using Go. Additionally, for a better user experience (UX), I might consider developing a GUI version.
