# PXREM CLI - NODE VERSION

## What's this?

This is a small CLI made to convert all pixels values from web dev related files to rem ones. The default root font size used for calculation is 16, but another one can be specified. See below for valid parameters.

## Alternatives

Note that you can do directly in VSCode what this CLI does.

## Why?

This small project was made for fun over a couple of free hours. I am primarily a front-end dev working with React. It was a blast from the past to work in a self-imposed OOP paradigm. I could have built this small app in a procedural paradigm for sure. As many devs, I am guilty to over-engineer things sometimes.

## What's next?

As I am writing this, I am in the process of learning Go just for fun. I could very well write the equivalent using Go. Also, it would probably be better UX-wise to write a version with a GUI.
